-- EXPLORATARY DATA ANALYSIS
/* Next Step: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & KPI Insights
After successful data cleaning, the next step involves conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract key insights from the dataset. 
The goal is to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships between player attributes and performance indicators. This will include:
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing age, value, wages, and OVA distribution.
Position-wise Breakdown: Identifying top performers per position (ST, GK, CM, etc.).
Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships (e.g., between Physical traits and OVA).
KPI Dashboards: Creating visual summaries (bar charts, heatmaps) for performance, financials, and growth potential.
Identifying Outliers: Detecting standout players or anomalies in wages/value.
This step will provide a data-driven foundation for player performance insights and help build meaningful dashboards or reports.*/
